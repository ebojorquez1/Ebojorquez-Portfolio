        My journey with web design began in the summer of 2021 at Texas State
        Technical College. In less than a year I have learned more than I ever
        would have imagined. I have gained a strong foundation in Web Design &
        Development. This along with my aptitude of learning new things quickly,
        has confidently prepared me to make it a profession.

        What began as an opportunity to gain knowledge in web design and
        development through a certification program led me through a path that
        chanels my creativity and challenges my strength of data and analytical
        decision making.I value the commitment of teamwork, trust and above all
        - strong work ethic. As a former educator, I believe in being a lifelong
        learner. That being said, I have undoubtedly found my niche!
