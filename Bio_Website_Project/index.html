        I'm a Texas Girl, born and raised. I was born on March 13, 1978, in
        Brownsville, Texas, and am your typical cliche Pieces. I am creative,
        outgoing, caring, and strong willed (although my husband prefers to use
        the word stubborn). I was a teacher and administrator for almost 20
        years until the summer of 2021 when I made the decission to focus on my
        family and persue my goal of becoming an independent consultant.
        Although I am no longer working full time, I am far from "not working".
        A few things my kiddos are currently keeping me busy with include a
        college and high school graduation as well as my little one's first year
        of preschool (bus pickup and all)!

        My life beyond my children includes gardening (which none of my children
        share and I'm okay with that), cooking, and letting my husband spoil me
        with back massages, wine and a cheesey lifetime movie. I
        <strong>LOVE</strong> expressing my analytical thinking and creativity
        to help others take their business to levels they never thought possible
        before. I'm driven by the possibilities of growth that my hard work and
        experience can provide.
