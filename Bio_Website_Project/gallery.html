        I work hard in a field I love and keep busy with a family of seven, but
        whenever possible I try to incorporate the hobbies and interests I enjoy
        doing with my family. Although the teenagers no longer find in cool to
        cook with mom, I can still rely on Olivia (4yr) being mommy's assistand
        in the kitchen. The same could be said for my time spent gardening or
        working on home improvements. If I'm being totally honest, my older
        children have shared that they rather keep their distance when mom is
        working on her "projects". I don't complain since my "projects" equally
        serve as my R&R time. One hobby that has seemed to link everyone's
        interest is puzzlemaking. And be warned - THE PUZZLE MUST BE COMPLETED
        BEFORE WE SLEEP - or it mysteriously ends up completed by morning. And
        when it comes to getting away...Vegas Baby!
